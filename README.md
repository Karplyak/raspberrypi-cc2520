raspberrypi-cc2520
==================

Code, hardware, and instructions to use the TI CC2520 with the Raspberry Pi.


Software
--------

### Kernel

You need the kernel module from https://github.com/ab500/linux-cc2520-driver.

### TinyOS

You need a copy of the main TinyOS repository and the tinyos folder from this repo.


Hardware
--------

Currently we have an interface board that allows you to use the CC2520EM evaluation module with the raspberry pi.
We intend to wrap those into a single board.
