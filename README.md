raspberrypi-cc2520
==================

Code, hardware, and instructions to use the TI CC2520 with the Raspberry Pi.


Software
--------

### Kernel

You need the kernel module from https://github.com/ab500/linux-cc2520-driver.

You also need to enable IPV6. Edit `/etc/modules` and add `ipv6` to the end
of the file.

### TinyOS

You need a copy of the main TinyOS repository and the tinyos folder from this repo.

#### Installation

The TinyOS code requires a library for the low level BCM2835 GPIO from
http://www.open.com.au/mikem/bcm2835/. Download and compile it on the RPI as shown.
In order to cross compile the tinyos code on your machine you need also need the
library and headers on your local machine.

    -insert code for that here-
    mv libbcm2835.a /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/lib
    mv bcm2835.h /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include

In order for the TinyOS build system to figure out all the correct paths you
need to help it along a bit. Add the following to your `.bashrc` file:

    export TOSROOTRPI=<path to git repo>/tinyos
    export TOSMAKE_PATH="$TOSROOTRPI/support/make $TOSMAKE_PATH"

#### Usage

Assuming you have the correct compilers, you should be able to run the following in
`tinyos-main/apps/Blink` and have it compile successfully:

    make raspberrypi

Then copy `build/raspberrypi/main.exe` to the RPI and you should be able to run
it:

    ./main.exe


#### Testing

Run BorderRouter on the rpi, Node on mote and mcast.py on the rpi. Then watch the packets fly!

#### Setup a Network

Because the world is a very slow moving place, using IPv6 is not exactly trivial
at this point.


Addresses
---------

    Subnet for wsn              : 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7890::/112
    subnet for rest of computers: 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891::/112

    border router:              : 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891:1/112%eth0
    memristor                   : 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891:2/112
    nuclear                     : 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891:3/112


    rpi:
    sudo ip -6 addr add 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891:1/112 dev eth0
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1

    memristor:
    sudo ip -6 addr add 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7891:2/112 dev eth0
    sudo ip -6 route add 2607:f018:800a:bcde:f012:3456:7890::/112 dev eth0

Hardware
--------

Currently we have an interface board that allows you to use the CC2520EM evaluation module with the raspberry pi.
We intend to wrap those into a single board.



To Do
-----

The driver needs some work to get it to work in the general TinyOS environment, as well as to work with BLIP.

- [x] Add BareReceive and BareSend interfaces to CC2520Rpi driver
  - This allows the BLIP stack to use extended 802.15.4 addressing internally.
- [ ] Check on how I'm setting the seq numbers
  - For the blip driver at least, I think I'm doing good things.
- [ ] Clean up setting RSSI, channel, etc.
- [ ] Create BorderRouter application.
  - Create an interface for the wireless network.
    - Send all incoming packets to the border router to that interface.
    - Let linux decide what to do with the packet (send to dhcp server, internet, or back to the border router app)
    - When packets come back in use rpl to route as normal back in to the wsn
