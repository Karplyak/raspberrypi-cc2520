Some thoughts on approach:
--------------------------
Would it be better to perhaps just implement a new component,
let's call it CC2520RadioInterfaceC, that exposes all of required
Blip interfaces (see below)?

	Yeah. I wanted to be able to compile RadioCountToLeds so I
	connected the ActiveMessage stuff and whatnot. But CC2520RpiRadioBareC
	does what you're talking about. Well, it's close. I don't like some of the stupid
	interfaces BLIP wired to. So I made my own: PacketMetadata.

	BLIP needs to be converted to use generic interfaces. Until then I have
	CC2420RadioC and ReadLqiC in the platform folder to do the translation.

I'm not sure there's much value in really duplicating the
full hierarchy of the radio stack when we need so little of
it. We can instead create a very lean TinyOS component that
shouldn't take much time at all to develop, and should be
easy enough to test. 

I would propose creating that component along with a basic
application that uses printf statements and consumes said
component, testing basic functionality. From there we would
have to do minimal work in blip, just replacing IPDispatchC
with an implementation that wires up our new component.

	We should fix BLIP to use generic interfaces and get it in
	the TinyOS tree.

Blip Interfaces:
-----------------------------
SplitControl as RadioControl
- just provides start/stop of the radio interface. this will basically
  be a NOOP for all intents and purposes.
- calls startDone, stopDone events at the conclusion of start/stop
  commands.

Packet as BarePacket
- does simple byte manipulation of message_t.

	This doesn't really do anything but return pointers to message_t or simple values.
	I implemented this in CC2520RpiRadioBareP.nc. Not quite finished yet.

Send as Ieee154Send
- queues the sending of IEEE 802.15.4 packets. will
  need to interact with the CC2520 driver and schedule
  sending of packets, call sendDone when complete.
- for cancel command, just return FAIL.
- why the heck is getPayload duplicated in this interface?

	Re getPayload dup, from tep116: "The duplication of some of the
	commands in Packet is solely for ease of use: maxPayloadLength
	and getPayload MUST behave identically as Packet.maxPayloadLength
	and Packet.getPayload. Their inclusion is so that components do
	not have to wire to both Packet and the sending interface for
	basic use cases."
	Dumb.

Receive as Ieee154Receive
- just a single event to be fired when packets are received.

	Send and Receive have to do basic manipulations on the length
	due to what BLIP expects. See http://docs.tinyos.net/tinywiki/index.php/BLIP_2.0_Platform_Support_Guide
	"The Bare* family of interfaces refer to methods of accessing the radio
	where the "payload" starts at the first octet of the IEEE 802.15.4 header
	(the length byte), and all lengths refer to the number of bytes in the frame
	including the length byte: therefore the maximum length is 128. Note this is
	different from the value in the 802.15.4 header since that value does not
	include the length byte."

	Also I went with the default names of the interfaces because I thought that
	was pretty clear. ex: CC2520RpiRadioBareC.Send(). They don't really do anything
	with 802.15.4 frames.

		Ahh. From that page I see "IPDispatchC should reference a generic Ieee154 component, something like BareIeee154C or something." We shall (eventually)
		implement that BareIeee154C interface instead of all this adopting.

		Also... I thinkkk I support extended addresses, but I'm not sure how well.
		Needs to be tested. 

ReadLqi
- just read the RSSI and LQI from the tail end of the packet.

LowPowerListening
- blip just sets LPL on every outgoing message. Just ignore
  this nonsense and continue on.

	I've ignored LPL at this point. I don't think we really have to
	do much, but we do need to create a file to wire to at some point.

PacketLink
- this actually needs to be carefully implemented to retry
  packets and delay appropriately. I considered implementing
  it in the driver but it's not timing critical or important.
- add some metadata to the packet and coordinate with the 
  sending machinery to do this correctly.

	I believe BLIP handles this. The PacketLink commands BLIP uses are
	very simple and I wrapped them into PacketMetadata.

		The big thing it does is provide a little bit more reliability.
		As it stands right now the PacketLink layer is responsible
		for sending the packet multiple times if the driver returns
		an error code. 


Border Router
-------------

To make a proper border router application, here's what I think the TinyOS
app needs to do.

The TinyOS app creates a network interface and sets a certain ipv6 prefix to
be routed to that interface (all in linux land). This prefix will be used to give
all wireless nodes their addresses. Then BLIP behaves normally except if it
receives a packet from the wsn destined for itself, it always forwards that packet
to the linux network interface. Then linux can send it to whatever application
is bound to that port.

That last part means auxillary parts of blip have to do a little more. Right now
there is a shell interface and maybe something else built into blip that binds to a 
UDP port in blip. This would need to bind not to blip but to the linux routing
architecture.

Setting it up this way means adding a dhcpv6 server to the pi should be trivial.

	That sounds really good! Just out of curiosity, has anyone explored using 
	stateless autoconfiguration? I think it might be a much better match
	for this stuff than a dhcpv6 server. 

	I think for now we can stick with using the PPP tunneling interface to get
	this stuff online, just with the changes to blip you mentioned to make sure
	all packets get routed to the linux host.
