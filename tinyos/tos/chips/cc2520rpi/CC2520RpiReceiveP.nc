/* This is the low level receive module that gets packets from the CC2520 kernel
 * module.
 * On init, a receive thread is created that blocks on the character driver.
 * After the receive thread receives a packet, it locks the transfer buffer,
 * copies the packet in and then signals the main thread. The main thread then
 * locks the transfer buffer, copies it into the message_t buffer and signals
 * the upper layers.
 * This seems clumsy to me, and I'm not sure if there is a better way, but it
 * keeps the data in the main thread and should handle packets that arrive
 * in rapid succession.
