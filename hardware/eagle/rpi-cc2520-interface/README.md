RPi - CC2520 Interface
======================

This board bridges the RPi and the TI CC2520EM evaluation module.

Revision B is known to be working, but requires an expensive EVM. A newer
design can be found in the rpi-cc2520 folder.


Rev B
-----

- Wired the radio GPIO lines directly on the PCB.
- Added LEDs.

Rev A
-----

- Fits the CC2520EM. Requires jumper wires between the radio GPIOs and the RPi
GPIOs.
